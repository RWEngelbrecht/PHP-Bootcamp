<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix class handles 4x4 matrices.

It has a finite set of class constants used as presets to define what type of matrix is created:
IDENTITY 	: Identity matrix;
SCALE	 	: Scale a matrix;
RX		 	: Rotate on x axis;
RY		 	: Rotate on y axis;
RZ		 	: Rotate on z axis;
TRANSLATION : Translation matrix;
PROJECTION	: Projection matrix;

Must construct with an array containing the following keys:
'preset'	: Mandatory. Sets the type of matrix created. Value must be one of
			  the class constants.
'scale'		: Scale factor. Mandatory when 'preset' set to SCALE.
'angle'		: Rotation angle in radians. Mandatory when 'preset' set to RX, RY
			  or RZ.
'vtc'		: Translation vector. Mandatory when 'preset' set to TRANSLATION.
'fov'		: Projection field of view in degrees. Mandatory when 'preset' set
			  to PROJECTION.
'ratio'		: Projection image ratio. Mandatory when 'preset' set to PROJECTION.
'near'		: Projection matrix's near clipping plane. Mandatory when 'preset'
			  set to PROJECTION.
'far'		: Projection matrix's far clipping plane. Mandatory when 'preset'
			  set to PROJECTION.

When an instance of Matrix is constructed, its values won't be changeable.

The class contains the following methods:
Matrix  mult( $rhs )		: returns new Matrix that is the multiplied matrix
							  of the calling instance and the given matrix.
Vertex  transformVertrex()	: returns new Vertex transformed by the calling
							  matrix.
